## Puzzler Name Game

Made in 2017 for Puzzler under Finblade, this was the studios first Unity project with a development time of around 3 months on which I was responsible for the entirety of the client application. No longer available, however a trailer is still viewable on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-LweWh4FoE)

## Isometric Chess

Iso-Chess was made in 2017 as a personal development project, just to see what it would be like to implement the full set of chess rules, including the en-passant and pawn promotion rules, as a 2-player game. It features selectable color palettes and a pixel-perfect render-scale based on the display resolution.

It can be found on itch.io [here](https://theadrain.itch.io/retro-chess) as a WebGL player, alternatively a Win64 build is also available.

## Kitty Quest

Kitty Quest was made in just 7 days for Gameboy Jam 2016 using Unity and features 5 levels across which the player must rescue an assortment of cute animal friends. In the short timeframe alloted to build the game, a simple pipeline was setup using Unitys scriptable importers in order to convert levels built in the open source map editor [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to Unity GameObjects including placement of all level objects such as the animals, obstacles, enemies and one-way platforms. This work was done on the first day before the player movement was even implemented, to allow the artist to start crafting levels immediately.
