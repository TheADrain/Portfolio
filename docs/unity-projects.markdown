## Isometric Chess

Iso-Chess was made in 2017 as a personal development project, just to see what it would be like to implement the full set of chess rules, including the en-passant and pawn promotion rules, as a 2-player game. It features selectable color palettes and a pixel-perfect render-scale based on the display resolution.

It can be found on itch.io [here](https://theadrain.itch.io/retro-chess) as a WebGL player, alternatively a Win64 is also available.
