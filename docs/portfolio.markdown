## **Professional Projects**

**Golf Clash (iOS/Android/PC)**

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}other/gc2.png" alt="GolfClash"/>

[Golf Clash](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/golf-clash) is one of the leading mobile games in the US and UK with over 100 million downloads globally. I have contributed to several game features using the in-house engine, including 'Checkpoint Challenge' and have developed internal tools and contributed to engine development using both C and C#.

**Puzzler Name Game (Unity, iOS/Android/Amazon)**

Made in 2017 for Puzzler under Finblade, this was the studios first Unity project with a development time of around 3 months on which I was responsible for the entirety of the client application. No longer available, however a trailer is still viewable on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-LweWh4FoE)

**Puzzler World (Cocos2D, iOS/Android/Amazon)**

Puzzler World is a suite of 15 different apps that host different kinds of puzzle games including crosswords and image-based puzzles, I was responsible primarily for small updates and bugfixes during my time at Finblade Studios while working simultaneously on other projects.

## **Personal Projects**

You can find more projects over on my [itch.io page](https://theadrain.itch.io/)

**Moonspear (Gameboy, C/ASM/Tools in C#)**

Built for the original Gameboy using a mix of C and ASM, using [GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and compiled with the [Small Device C Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Device_C_Compiler)

[Available to download here](https://github.com/TheADrain/portfolio/raw/main/docs/other/moonspear.gb) but must either be played with an emulator (I recommend BGB) or a real gameboy.

I built an actor system that supports a maximum of 10 animated characters using the 40 available hardware sprites, and a custom art pipeline and tools to handle converting [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) maps and associated tilesets over to 2BPP format, discarding duplicate tiles and generating collision data.

**Isometric Chess (Unity, WebGL/PC/OSX)**

Iso-Chess was made in 2017 as a personal development project, just to see what it would be like to implement the full set of chess rules, including the en-passant and pawn promotion rules, as a 2-player game. It features selectable color palettes and a pixel-perfect render-scale based on the display resolution.

[Available to play on itch.io as a WebGL player](https://theadrain.itch.io/retro-chess), alternatively a Win64 build is also available.

**Kitty Quest (Unity, PC/OSX)**

Kitty Quest was made in just 7 days for Gameboy Jam 2016 using Unity and features 5 levels across which the player must rescue an assortment of cute animal friends. In the short timeframe alloted to build the game, a simple pipeline was setup using Unitys scriptable importers in order to convert levels built in the open source map editor [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to Unity GameObjects including placement of all level objects such as the animals, obstacles, enemies and one-way platforms. This work was done on the first day before the player movement was even implemented, to allow the artist to start crafting levels immediately.

**Quake Maps**

I've been using Trenchbroom since late 2021 with a specific focus on making vanilla-style maps for Quake that look and feel like something out of the original game (with a few more brushes) you can find all my maps, and my 4-map episode 'Cold Light' over at my [Slipgate Sightseer](https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?members/theadrain.174/#resources) profile.
